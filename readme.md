# LED Matrix Clock
This project was for [Hackerbox #65 64x32 LED Matrix Clock](https://hackerboxes.com/collections/past-hackerboxes/products/hackerbox-0065-realtime). 

## Description
I designed the 3D printed legs in Fusion360 to stand the clock up on my desk. In my `.ino` file, I gathered the current date and time for a basic clock. Underneath the time, if it was during 'work hours' it would give you the time left till the end of the work day.
